Hand Gesture mouse control helps the user to control the system using simple gestures where you
can connect and interact with the system contactlessly. This project introduces a real-time hand
gesture-based cursor control system that allows users to navigate and interact with their computers
using simple hand movements. Using various Python libraries such as Tkinter for creating the
graphical user interface (GUI) and OpenCV for gesture detection by setting a standard webcam that
captures hand movements and processes them using the MediaPipe framework, which detects
hand movements and hand gestures with high accuracy. It uses NumPy to calculate and analyze
the distance between finger points to detect the function of the hand gesture; PyAutoGUI helps in
controlling the mouse functions; and the project incorporates time for handling time-based functions
such as delays and sys for accessing system-level operations. One of the main advantage of this
project is it will help people with physical disabilities who may struggle with traditional input devices.
